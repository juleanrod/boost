### What is the difference between a carriage return and line return?

The carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) are control characters used to denote the end of a line of text and to control the movement of the cursor on a display device.

- **Carriage Return (CR)**: The carriage return character is represented by `\r` or `0x0D` in hexadecimal, and `13` in decimal. It moves the cursor to the beginning of the line without advancing to the next line.

- **Line Feed (LF)**: The line feed character is represented by `\n` or `0x0A` in hexadecimal, and `10` in decimal. It moves the cursor down to the next line without returning to the beginning of the line.

In Unix-like systems (including macOS and Linux), a line feed (LF) alone creates a new line and returns the cursor to the start of the line. In contrast, Windows uses a combination of carriage return and line feed (CRLF, `\r\n`) to achieve the same effect. First, it generates a new line with the line feed, and then it returns the cursor to the start of the line with the carriage return.

The origin of these characters dates back to the era of mechanical typewriters and teletype machines. The carriage return was used to return the carriage to the beginning of the line, while the line feed advanced the paper to the next line.

### How do I print a carriage return in output?

To print a carriage return output in a terminal or console, you can use the escape sequence \r in many programming languages. This escape sequence represents the carriage return character, which moves the cursor back to the beginning of the current line without advancing to the next line.

### What's POSIX and why do I care?

POSIX, which stands for Portable Operating System Interface, is a set of standards defined by the IEEE for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. These standards are particularly important for Unix-like operating systems, which include Linux, macOS, and BSD. The main reason to care about POSIX is that it provides a consistent interface for software development, allowing programs to be written once and run on any POSIX-compliant system without modification.

Here are some reasons why POSIX matters:

Interoperability: POSIX ensures that software written for one POSIX-compliant system can be expected to work on another. This means that developers can focus on writing code once and deploying it across various environments without worrying about compatibility issues.
Standardization: POSIX provides a common set of tools, utilities, and system calls that are available on all compliant systems. This standardization simplifies the process of developing and maintaining software across different platforms.
Compatibility: Many open-source tools and utilities are designed to be POSIX-compliant, which makes them portable and reliable across different Unix-like operating systems.
Scripting and Automation: Shell scripting is heavily influenced by POSIX standards, which means scripts written according to POSIX guidelines should behave consistently across different systems. This is crucial for automation tasks and system administration.
Open Source Ecosystem: The open-source community relies on POSIX compliance to ensure that software can be freely shared and used across different systems. Compliance with POSIX helps to foster a vibrant ecosystem where software can be developed and distributed widely.
Job Market: Knowledge of POSIX is often required for jobs related to system administration, software development, and network engineering, especially in roles that involve working with Unix-like systems.
Education: Understanding POSIX is beneficial for students and professionals learning about operating systems and computer science, as it provides a foundation for understanding how different systems interact and operate.
In summary, caring about POSIX is essential for anyone involved in software development, system administration, or working with Unix-like operating systems, as it facilitates the creation of portable, reliable, and consistent software across a wide range of systems.

### How do I filter out only certain lines of a file?

To filter out only certain lines of a file, you can use various command-line tools or programming languages. One of the most common tools for this purpose is grep, which is used to search for patterns within files. However, if you want to exclude lines that match a pattern, you can use grep with the -v option.

Here's an example using grep to filter out lines containing the word "error":

```sh
grep -v 'error' inputfile.txt > outputfile
```

### How do I search within a file from command line?

Theres many utilities available: `ag`, `awk`, `grep`, `sed`, `find`
All of them have their unique use-case, so refer to man pages to dig dipper on them.

The following is an example if you need to find files that contain a specific pattern before searching within those files, you can combine `find` with `grep`:

```sh
find . -type f -exec grep -l 'search_pattern' {} \;
```

### What is the difference between "basic" and "extended" regex?

Basic Regular Expressions (BRE) and Extended Regular Expressions (ERE) are two types of regular expression syntax supported by various tools like grep, sed, and awk. The primary difference between them lies in the features and the syntax they offer for pattern matching.

Basic Regular Expressions (BRE):

BRE is the default regular expression syntax used by tools like grep and sed.  It uses backslashes (\) to escape special characters and meta-characters.  BRE supports a limited set of metacharacters compared to ERE.  To use alternation and grouping in BRE, you must escape the parentheses with a backslash, e.g., \( and \).
In BRE, anchors like ^ and $ don't always need to be escaped unless they are used away from their usual positions.
Extended Regular Expressions (ERE):

ERE is a more powerful version of BRE and is supported by tools like grep -E and sed -E.
It allows the use of unescaped parentheses for grouping and does not require escaping of some metacharacters like (, ), {, }, |, etc.
ERE supports more complex constructs like alternation without needing to escape the pipe character.
Word anchors like \b and \B are available in ERE, which are not present in BRE.
Switching between BRE and ERE can affect the number of escape characters needed for certain patterns. For example, in ERE, you donâ€™t need to escape parentheses for grouping, which reduces the complexity of the regular expression. Conversely, in BRE, you would need to escape parentheses with backslashes for them to have their special meaning.

In summary, ERE offers more flexibility and less verbosity due to fewer escape requirements, making it suitable for more complex patterns. On the other hand, BRE is simpler and might be easier for beginners to understand initially.

### How do I limit output to just the n-th column using `awk`?

```sh
awk '{print $n}' filename
```
