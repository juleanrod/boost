# Installing a virtual machine

1. Install a virtual box
2. Install an ubuntu server [!manually](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server)
    * This way so that our skills transfer to any platform (AWS, Azure, etc)
    * Server version emulates a cloud on our machine
3. The process of intalling a the server into our brand new virtual machine, is like 
if you were sticking an USB into a brand new computer that has no OS yet
4. Set about 2048 MB RAM
5. Set about 20GB disk

***NOTE: You might have to ennable "hypervisor" in your BIOS. Every BIOS and computer is different.***

Now we have to actually go through the boot process and do the server configuration. Almost all the defaults are correct. Thee difference is that we will enable SSH server and GPG packages.

6. Leave proxy black (only needed behind firewall)
