### What is lexicographical/lexical sorting?

Lexical sorting, also known as lexicographical order, is a method of sorting sequences of ordered symbols, such as characters in a string. It is a generalization of the alphabetical order used in dictionaries. Lexical sorting is based on comparing the elements of the sequences in a certain order, typically from left to right.

In lexical sorting:

Two strings are compared character by character.
The comparison stops as soon as a pair of characters is found that are in different order.
The string whose first differing character has a higher value in the collating sequence comes first.
For example, in lexicographical order, the string "apple" comes before "apples" because the first differing character is 'e' in "apple" and 's' in "apples," and 'e' comes before 's'.
